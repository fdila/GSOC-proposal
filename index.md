## Getting started

If you're new to the subject you can following all the course in order, as it is structured to start from the very basic and will leave no blank points, or you can check specific pages if you're already familiar with Digital Logic Design.
However we suggest to go through all the course, as you could always learn something, even if you thought you already knew the topic.

What will you learn?

* Binary representation of numbers and binary operations 
* Gates, Truth Tables, and Logic Equations
* Basic Logic Function Minimization 
* Combinational Logic
* Clocks, timing methodologies
* Sequential Logic Elements
* Multiplexers and Comparators
* Decoders and Register Files
* Finite State Machines
* ALU, computational blocks
* Basic Computer Datapath
